## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered comment generation using OpenRouter API
- üì± Simple popup interface for configuration
- üéØ Automatically processes LinkedIn feed posts directly on the page
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable comment style guide
- üîÑ Single-mode processing with proper delays

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenRouter API Key**: Get one from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. **LinkedIn Account**: Must be logged into LinkedIn in your browser
3. **Chrome Browser**: Extension is built for Chrome

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
4. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist_chrome` folder

## Usage

1. **Setup**:
   - Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
   - Enter your OpenRouter API key
   - Write a style guide for your comments (e.g., "Professional but friendly, ask questions, share insights, keep under 50 words")
   - Configure your settings:
     - **Feed Scroll Duration**: Time to scroll and load posts (5-30 seconds)
     - **Max Posts**: Maximum number of posts to comment on (5-50)
     - **Comment Delay**: Seconds between each comment (5-60 seconds)

2. **Start Auto-Commenting**:
   - Make sure you're logged into LinkedIn
   - Click "Start Auto Commenting" in the popup
   - The extension will:
     - Open LinkedIn feed in an active tab
     - Scroll down to load posts for the specified duration
     - Scroll back to the top
     - Process posts one by one directly on the feed page
     - Generate and post AI comments with proper delays
     - Stop when the maximum post limit is reached

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Watch the process in real-time on the LinkedIn feed tab
   - Check the popup for progress updates (e.g., "5/20 comments posted")
   - You can stop the process anytime by clicking "Stop Auto Commenting"

## How It Works

1. **Feed Loading**: Scrolls LinkedIn feed to load multiple posts
2. **Direct Processing**: Processes posts directly on the feed page without opening individual tabs
3. **Author Duplicate Check**: Tracks commented authors to avoid duplicate comments in the same session
4. **Content Analysis**: Extracts post content from each visible post
5. **AI Generation**: Sends post content + style guide to OpenRouter API
6. **Comment Posting**: Simulates typing and submits the generated comment
7. **Smart Limits**: Stops when maximum posts reached or no more posts available

## Configuration

### Style Guide Examples

- **Professional**: "Keep it professional, add value, ask thoughtful questions"
- **Casual**: "Be friendly and conversational, use emojis sparingly, share personal experiences"
- **Analytical**: "Provide data-driven insights, ask about metrics, reference industry trends"
- **Supportive**: "Be encouraging and positive, offer help or resources, celebrate achievements"

### Settings

- **Feed Scroll Duration**: 5-30 seconds (default: 10s)
- **Max Posts to Comment On**: 5-50 posts (default: 20)
- **Seconds Between Each Comment**: 5-60 seconds (default: 10s)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No posts found**: Make sure you're on LinkedIn feed and logged in
2. **Comments not posting**: Check if comment boxes are available (some posts may have comments disabled)
3. **API errors**: Verify your OpenRouter API key is correct and has credits
4. **Extension not working**: Check browser console for error messages

### LinkedIn Changes

LinkedIn frequently updates their UI. If the extension stops working:
- Check the console for selector errors
- The extension may need updates to match new LinkedIn class names

## Security & Privacy

- API key is stored locally in the extension
- No data is sent anywhere except to OpenRouter for comment generation
- Extension only accesses LinkedIn pages when actively running
- All processing happens locally in your browser

## Development

To modify the extension:

1. Edit source files in `src/`
2. Rebuild with `pnpm build`
3. Reload the extension in Chrome extensions page

Key files:
- `src/pages/popup/Popup.tsx`: User interface
- `src/pages/background/index.ts`: Main automation logic
- `src/pages/content/index.tsx`: LinkedIn page interaction
- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration

## Limitations

- Only works on LinkedIn
- Requires manual API key setup
- May break if LinkedIn updates their UI
- Rate limited by OpenRouter API limits
- Should be used responsibly to avoid spam

## Legal & Ethical Use
